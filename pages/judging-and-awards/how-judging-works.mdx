# How Judging Works

## Track Judging

Judging is done by a panel of judges. Each judge is an expert in their field and includes a mix of academic professors and industry professionals. The judging process at WildHacks is outlined below.

### Round 1 - Initial Judging

During the initial judging round, judges will review all [submissions](/project-guidelines/submission) and score them based on the [WildHacks project evaluation criteria](/judging-and-awards/project-evaluation). Each project will have multiple judges assigned to it and the average score will be used as the project's final score for round 1. The top 10 projects (or more in the case of ties) will move on to round 2.

### Round 2 - Live Presentations

The teams with the top-scoring projects will be invited to present their projects to the judges (and other hackers) in a live presentation. Rather than a short video pitch that emphasizes both a quick demo and discussion of the problem and tech stack, the live presentations focus more on a deep demo of the project's functionality and serve as an interactive way for judges to evaluate the projects. Each team will have 5 minutes total to present their project and judge Q+A. Teams are encouraged to demo for 2 minutes to ensure that they have 3 minutes for Q+A from judges.

All judges review all top projects and will select the winning teams, which will be announced during the closing ceremony. The highest and lowest scores will be dropped from each team, with the remaining scores averaged.

    Top teams will have exactly 5 minutes to present. The organizing team will cut teams off if they exceed 5 minutes.

## Challenge Judging

### MLH Challenges

All challenges presented by MLH will be judged by an MLH representative while track judging is taking place. Winning teams will be announced during the closing ceremony.

### Crowd Favorite

During round 1 of track judging, hackers will have the opportunity to present their projects to the crowd. The crowd will vote on their favorite projects, and the project with the highest vote will be awarded the Crowd Favorite prize. The Crowd Favorite prize will be announced during the closing ceremony. Only projects who choose to enter the Crowd Favorite challenge will be eligible to present and win.
