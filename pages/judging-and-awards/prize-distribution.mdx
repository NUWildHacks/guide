# Prize Distribution

All awards will be announced during the closing ceremony, but that isn't necessarily when you'll receive your prizes.

While some prizes will distributed during the closing ceremony, many WildHacks prizes will not be awarded during the event but instead within a couple of weeks afterwards.

If you're a Northwestern student and win a prize, we'll reach out to you when your prize is ready to be picked up. If you're not a Northwestern student, we'll reach out to you to discuss how to get your prize to you.
