# Project Evaluation

## Areas of Evaluation

### Technical Complexity (30%)

The hack should be technically impressive for a 24-hour project. They should have code and a functioning demo. Anything from frameworks, APIs, algorithms, & more to interesting languages can add to the technical difficulty of the project.

### Usefulness (30%)

The hack doesn't have to be business-ready but should have the potential to be useful in everyday life. It should also be intuitive and easy to use.

### Originality (20%)

The hack should be unique and interesting. This can range from a new spin on a known idea to completely outlandish ideas. The hack should be something damn cool you've never seen before.

### Design (15%)

The hack should look and work beautifully. The closer it looks and feels to a professional-grade application, the better.

### Presentation (5%)

The demo video should be engaging and show how the project would be used. It should also explain the mission and intended outcome behind the project.

| Technical Complexity (30%) | The project is not interactive or doesn't utilize code (Ex: Wix, Google Sites, Figma)                    | The project makes use of some frameworks, APIs, algorithms, etc but is not technically difficult. Something that could easily be built within 24 hours. | The project uses difficult-to-use frameworks, APIs, and/or algorithms. Something that would be difficult to build in 24 hours.                                     | The project uses remarkably complex frameworks, APIs, and/or algorithms. Something that judges find incredible to have been built in 24 hours.                                   |
| Usefulness (30%)           | Very little or no application. None or poorly identified target users. Challenging to use/not intuitive. | Has applications to real-world problems, but may not be used often by the target audience.                                                              | Successfully addresses a relevant issue to a clearly defined target audience. The target user can, and likely would incorporate this project into their lifestyle. | Identifies and addresses a unique, key need to a clearly defined target audience. Highly intuitive for the target user, they would be excited to incorporate it into their life. |
| Originality (20%)          | There are already existing solutions/projects that are very similar.                                     | The project adds a twist on an established project/solution but is still widely based on an existing project.                                           | The project is novel or adds an exciting twist to an existing project/technology that makes it better than the original.                                           | The project is groundbreaking and is something judges have never seen before/would never have thought of. Stands out amongst other projects.                                     |
| Design (15%)               | The project lacks consistency and looks unpolished.                                                      | The project has inconsistent structure and uses clear aesthetics.                                                                                       | The project has a consistent structure and clear aesthetics. Takes advantage of colors and fonts to appeal to the eye.                                             | The project utilizes a coherent set of aesthetics and structure that work together to enrich the user's experience. Professional-grade project.                                  |
| Presentation (5%)          | Video is not present.                                                                                    | The video shows the project in action but does not explain the mission/reasoning behind it. The video is unengaging.                                    | Video shows how the project works and what it should be used for while being engaging and clear.                                                                   | The video goes beyond simply explaining the project but also connects it to the intended outcomes.
