# WildHacks 2024 Judging Guide

Thank you so much for judging at WildHacks 2024. We're so excited to have you. Here are some details about how judging will work at the hackathon.

Judging takes place on **Sunday, April 7, 2024**.

As a judge, you'll get:

- The opportunity to see some of the most innovative projects from students at Northwestern University and dozens of other universities around the country
- A free meal if you're judging in person

Thank you so much for volunteering your time to help make WildHacks a success. WildHacks is an entirely student-run volunteer-based student hackathon that aims to provide a welcoming and inclusive environment for all participants from all skill levels for free. We're glad that you can be a part of it.
