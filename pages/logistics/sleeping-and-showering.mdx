# Sleeping and Showering Accommodations

## Northwestern Students

If you're a Northwestern student, we recommend that you sleep in your dorm or apartment, as the sleeping accommodations in Mudd will be prioritized for non-Northwestern students.

## Non-Northwestern Students

If you're a non-Northwestern student, you can sleep on the third floor of Mudd, inside or outside collaboration rooms 1-4. We ask that you bring your own sleeping bag to ensure that you're comfortable.

If you want to make separate sleeping accommodations, feel free to see if any Northwestern students are willing to host you or book a room at a nearby Evanston hotel.

There are showers in the bathrooms of Mudd. Make sure to bring toiletries and other stuff you might need.

- Toothbrush
- Toothpaste
