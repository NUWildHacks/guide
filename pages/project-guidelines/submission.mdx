## Submission Requirements

All submissions must include **all** of the following:

- A link to a **public** GitHub repository containing all of your project's source code.
- A [showcase video](#showcase-video) **no longer than 2.5 minutes** showcasing your project.
- A written description of your project.

### Showcase Video

Your demo video is the first thing judges see for your project, so make sure it's engaging and shows off why your project deserves to win! Your video should at least somewhat be structured as follows:

- \~30 seconds: What problem your project is addressing, why it's important, and how your project solves it.
- \~30 seconds: What technologies your project uses (APIs, programming languages, frameworks, etc.).
- \~60 seconds: A demo that showcases the features of your project.
