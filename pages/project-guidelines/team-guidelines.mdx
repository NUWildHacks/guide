# Team Guidelines

A core component of the hackathon is the team-based approach to development. Note the following rules and guidelines for WildHacks.

- Teams must consist of a minimum of **1 member** and a maximum of **4 members**. You can compete individually, but we recommend working with others!
- Teams can change throughout the event. Whoever is on the final project submission will qualify for prizes for that project.
- To find a team, you can use [#find-teammates](discord://-/channels/1216913782132047974/1216916833719025744) before the event. At the start of the event, we'll have time for anyone who hasn't yet found a team to look for teammates.
