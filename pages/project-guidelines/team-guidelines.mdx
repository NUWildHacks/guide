# Team Guidelines

A core component of the hackathon is the team-based approach to development. Note the following rules and guidelines for WildHacks.

- Teams must consist of a minimum of **1 member** and a maximum of **4 members**. You can compete individually, but we recommend working with others!
- Teams can change throughout the event. Whoever is on the final project submission will qualify for prizes for that project.
- To find a team, you can use [#find-teammates](https://discord.com/channels/1340046559298982019/1342775351641772094) before the event. Right after opening ceremony, we will host a brief team formation event for anyone who hasn't found teammates.
