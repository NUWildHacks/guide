### Most Creative Adobe Express Add-On

_Presented by MLH_

[Adobe Express](https://hackp.ac/adobe-xp) is an AI-first, all-in-one content creation app that makes it fast, easy and fun to design and share videos, images, PDFs, flyers, TikToks, logos and more. Best of all, it's free to get started.

[Add-ons in Adobe Express](https://hackp.ac/adobe-xp-addons) are simply extensions and integrations that are built upon very powerful APIs. These APIs provide access to the user's document, connections to third-party tools, and so much more. You can extend the functionality of Adobe Express using add-ons to unlock new capabilities and workflows. [Check out these add-ons](https://hackp.ac/adobe-xp-inspo) to see what other cool ideas developers have implemented!

For this hackathon, we want you to build a creative add-on for Adobe Express. Users are looking for add-ons that involve assets like stickers or icons, work with presentations and data visualization, and work in roles like marketing and e-commerce. [Build an Adobe Express add-on](https://hackp.ac/adobe-xp-tutorial) this weekend for a chance to win a Wacom Wireless Drawing Tablet and JBL Go3 Speaker for you and each member of your team!

_\*You can also submit to this prize category if you have a prototype idea for an add-on or have a partially completed add-on. As long as you've built with Adobe Express, we want to see your hack!_

### Best Use of Starknet

_Presented by MLH_

Starknet is redefining the very notion of Web3 by tackling one of the most intimidating technical challenges in the industry - scaling a blockchain while maintaining its security and decentralization.

Starknet was the first general purpose ZK-Rollup service on Ethereum in Feb. 2022, and has proved its potential to be a market leader. Essentially, it increases the processing speed, while reducing the cost of operating on the Ethereum blockchain.

As a result, we are seeing a variety of “traditional” tech businesses - payments / social media / AI / online gaming - now being integrated with blockchains using our technology.

Moreover, the Starknet community is a growing pool of global talent - from feisty college students to some of the most illustrious PhDs in the world.

Wanna be a part of this growing community? Let's get you started!

### Best Use of Kintone

_Presented by MLH_

Still not sure what backend to use in your hack? [Kintone](https://hackp.ac/kintone) is a low-code web database that lets you set up your backend in minutes. It's beginner friendly, allowing you to customize your Kintone app using nothing but JavaScript and HTML. If you're interested in IoT, your team can snag a FREE microcontroller by [signing up for Kintone](https://hackp.ac/kintone-developer-license) and visiting the MLH table. If you [use Kintone in your hackathon project](https://hackp.ac/kintone-hackathon-idea), you'll have a chance to win a breadboard IoT kit to power up the hardware hacking for each member of your team!

### Best Use of AI in Education

_Presented by MLH_

Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, such as large language models (LLMs), are transforming how we interact with computers. During this weekend's hackathon, we want you to apply AI towards improving education to produce tools that support the quality, accessibility, and equitability of learning in today's classrooms. You can use AI to address any challenge teachers and students face, such as curriculum planning, question selection, teacher training, content generation, personalized feedback, automated grading and more.

For this challenge, we encourage you to draw on your own educational experiences and propose technical solutions to problems you've regularly encountered as students — after all, you are the best to know where our education system needs improvement. Design impactful and effective AI tools for education for a chance to win a TickTime Pomodoro Timer!

To give you some inspiration, we're sharing some educational and technical resources:

- [This list](http://hackp.ac/schmidt-LE-challenges) of the most pressing issues educational leaders have around AI
- An introduction to the emerging field of [Learning Engineering](http://hackp.ac/schmidt-LE-intro)
- [A map of AI in education](http://hackp.ac/schmidt-ai-map)
- A [recent competition series using LLMs](http://hackp.ac/schmidt-LLM) for automated essay evaluation
