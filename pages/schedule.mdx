# WildHacks 2025 Schedule

See the [event map](/map) for location details. All WildHackers are provided work spaces in [Mudd Library](https://www.library.northwestern.edu/libraries-collections/mudd-library/) and the [Technological Institute](https://maps.northwestern.edu/txt/facility/132). If you are an out-of-town WildHacker, we recommend you *do not* leave these designated areas.

## (Optional) Workshop Week

Workshop Week is a hybrid, *optional* collaboration to introduce newer WildHackers to software development topics. We are grateful to Northwestern's computing student organizations for hosting these sessions! ðŸ’“
