# WildHacks Workshop Night

On Friday, April 5, 2024 from 5:00 PM to 10:00 PM, we have a night filled with engaging workshops to help first-time hackers and those with minimal experience prepare themselves for the development portion of the hackathon. Find the schedule below. Note that there will not be any sleeping accommodations on this day for participants. For this reason, if you aren't able to make it this day, we'll be live streaming and recording all workshops so you can join online or watch them later. More information on that will be shared next week.

Workshops are around 30 minutes long, with 15 minutes of overlap to allow you to stay and ask questions if needed.
